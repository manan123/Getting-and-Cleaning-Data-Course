# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course

This repository consists of the code scripts (in R) and documentation files for the Data Science's track course 
"Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The dataset being used is:

Files

The code assumes that all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

"CodeBook.md" describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

"run_analysis.R" contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. These can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is saved in "avg_data.txt", and uploaded in the course project's form.
